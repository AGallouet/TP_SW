# Sliced Wasserstein Flows for Color Transfer

This repository contains a practical assignment focused on the implementation of **Sliced Wasserstein flows** using **PyTorch**, with an application to **color transfer between images**.

## Contents

* **Subject description**: The full assignment statement is available in `TP_sliced.pdf`.
* **Images**: Source and color images used for the experiments are located in the `images/` directory.
* **PyTorch quick guide**: A brief introduction to essential PyTorch and PIL functionalities is provided in `quick_guide.py`.

## Goal

The objective of this project is to:

* Implement an estimator of the Sliced Wasserstein distance,
* Compute its gradient and perform gradient descent on discrete measures,
* Apply Sliced Wasserstein flows to image color transfer,
* Gain hands-on experience with PyTorch, including GPU acceleration.

Feel free to adapt or extend the implementation to explore additional applications of Sliced Wasserstein methods.
